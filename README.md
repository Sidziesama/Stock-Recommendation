# Stock-Recommendation
This is my attempt to estimate the stock price of a company based on historical data and provide buying and selling recommendations from any basket of stocks 

## First test
I ran this model for 36 stocks in the month of January 2015. The model predicted the stocks that showed a growth potential for the next week and gave a 'Yes' or 'No' reccomendation 
### Test Results
By our selections, if we bought the stocks that had a 'Yes' selection, our model predicted that we would make a 42.10 % return on these stocks
In reality, the actual return on these stocks was 34.40 %. The model also missed out on 8 buying opportunities. 

Number of 'Yes' recommended stocks = 16 ; number of wrong predictions = 3

Number of 'No' recommended stocks = 20 ; number of wrong predictions = 8

Predicted Returns = 42.10 %    ;  Actual returns = 34.40 %

### Final Thoughts 
The model can still be made more efficient and it requires a lot more testing  before reaching any conclusions.
